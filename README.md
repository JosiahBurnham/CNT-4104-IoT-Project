# CNT-4104-IoT-Project
IoT project for Computer Networks (4104)

This project is an IoT Plant Watering System that utilizes a entirely serverless backend to make choices on watering based collectd sensor data.

The sensors are connected to the arduino.
The pump, and API calls are handled by an ESP 8266.
Communication between arduino and ESP are handled via serial connection.
